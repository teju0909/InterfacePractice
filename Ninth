Q9.What is the benefit of lambda expressions in Java 8?
Ans:
Lambda expressions are used to simplify and improve the readability of Java code. 

Benefits of using lambda expressions in Java:

Conciseness: Lambda expressions can be used to write concise and expressive code.
Readability: Lambda expressions can make code more readable by making it easier to understand 
			 the intent of the code.
Functional programming: Lambda expressions can be used to write functional code, which can make 
						code more reusable and easier to test.
Parallelism: Lambda expressions can be used to write parallel code, which can improve the performance 
			 of your application.

Examples of how lambda expressions can be used to improve the readability of Java code:

Stream operations: Lambda expressions can be used to define the operations that are performed on streams. 
				   This makes the code more concise and easier to understand.
Event handlers: Lambda expressions can be used to define the event handlers for GUI components. This 
				makes the code more concise and easier to understand.
Functional interfaces: Lambda expressions can be used to implement functional interfaces. This makes 
					   the code more concise and easier to understand.
