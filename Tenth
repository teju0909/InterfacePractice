Q10.Is it mandatory for a lambda expression to have parameters?
Ans:
No, it is not mandatory for a lambda expression to have parameters. A lambda expression can have 
zero, one, or multiple parameters.

If a lambda expression has no parameters, the parameter list is empty. For example, the following 
lambda expression has no parameters:


() -> System.out.println("Hello, world!");

If a lambda expression has one parameter, the parameter list is enclosed in parentheses. For example, 
the following lambda expression has one parameter:


(s) -> System.out.println(s);

If a lambda expression has multiple parameters, the parameter list is enclosed in parentheses, and 
the parameters are separated by commas. For example, the following lambda expression has two 
parameters:

Java
(s, t) -> System.out.println(s + t);

The decision of whether or not to include parameters in a lambda expression depends on the specific 
use case. In some cases, it may be helpful to include parameters in a lambda expression to make the 
code more readable and concise. In other cases, it may be more efficient to omit parameters from a 
lambda expression.
