Q5.What is the use of interface in Java?
Ans:
Interfaces are used in Java to achieve abstraction, multiple inheritance, and to define a contract 
between different classes.

Benefits of using interfaces in Java:

=> Abstraction: Interfaces allow you to define the behavior of a class without specifying the 
                implementation details. This makes your code more modular and easier to understand.

=> Multiple inheritance: Interfaces allow you to achieve multiple inheritance in Java. This means 
						 that a class can inherit from multiple interfaces, which can be useful for
						 defining complex objects.

=> Contract: Interfaces can be used to define a contract between different classes. This means that
			 the classes that implement the interface agree to provide certain functionality. This can be useful for ensuring that different parts of your code work together correctly.

Examples of how interfaces are used in Java:

1.The Runnable interface is used to define the behavior of a thread. Any class that implements the
  Runnable interface can be used to create a thread.
  
2.The Comparable interface is used to define the natural ordering of objects. Any class that 
  implements the Comparable interface can be compared to other objects of the same type.

3.The Observer interface is used to define the behavior of an object that observes other objects. 
  Any class that implements the Observer interface can be notified when other objects change.
